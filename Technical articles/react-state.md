## Complete guide to React UseState by building a dynamic date component

In React, state is the data or properties that we need to track and manipulate in order to create dynamic features for your application

UseState is a hook that allows you to pass state (data or properties) into functional components.

PS: A functional component is simply a JavaScript function that accepts data as a property (or prop) as it's argument and returns a React element (JSX). 

Remember, you can only call a a hook at the top level of your component. This means that you cannot call a useState hook in coditional renders or loops; you'd have to extract a new component from the initial state, and move the state into it.
