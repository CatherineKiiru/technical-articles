- glob - patterns that specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters.

- glob patterns - Also known as globs, are patterns that expand a wildcard pattern into a list of pathnames that match the given pattern.

- Wildcard Pattern - a string is considered a wildcard pattern if it contains any of these characters *, [, or ?. 

- Asterisks (*) - is a wildcard standing for "any string of characters except/". This is the most common wildcard. 

- Double Asterisks (**) - matches zero or more directories that fall under the current directory in a recursive manner (repeating itself until it matches the condition set)

- Usage - Glob patterns are used to scan your file system and return pathnames that match a predefined patterns set by your computer system. This helps in organizing your content files and folders without you having to do the configuration.
